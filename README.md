# Squibber for Dungeons and Dragons

This is my own personal set of scripts for running D&D.

# Notes for printing

These are some notes to myself about how to print these out.

* Load the 4x6 cards into main tray.
* Put the lined side up so it prints on the blank side
* Set the dimensions to 4x6
* Set the thickness to "Thick" paper
* Print with Portrait selected
